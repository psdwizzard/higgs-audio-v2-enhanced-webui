One morning, two years before, Charles's master had, having forgotten his past standing instructions,  instructed Charles to always check the travel arrangements first thing every morning.  This instruction never having been rescinded, Charles commenced each day repeating the task with which he had closed the previous one.  To some, this would lend a certain pleasing symmetry to the day.  Alternatively, the additional and unnecessary task might have been a source of annoyance.  Pleasure and annoyance were outside of Charles's remit.
