July 13th, 2081. On that day, it had been 55 years, eight months, and nine days since a human  being had been in space. I was the 204th person to go back, and part of the sixth extrasolar crew.  I'm writing to you in the hope that we will not be the last. I never knew an Earth that was unaware  of life elsewhere. The Cetus probe scooped up bacteria-laden samples from Europa's geysers  29 years before my birth. The first rover photographs of fossil anthropods on Mars  arrived while my parents were still in trade school.
