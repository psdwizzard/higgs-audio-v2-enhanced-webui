which was four massive primary-colored beanbags around a low table.  The table was one of those ones that had a magnetic bead  that dragged around blinding white sand under the glass,  making geometric patterns as it did so.  Currently, the bead was making a swirly pattern.  I picked the red beanbag and sank into it, only a little awkwardly.  My tablet briefly flopped out of my hand,  and I caught it before it skittered off the beanbag and onto the floor.
