# Discord Bot Configuration
# -------------------------
# IMPORTANT: You must also enable these in the Discord Developer Portal
# (https://discord.com/developers/applications) under Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents:
#   1. MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT  - required to read message text for @mention triggers
#   2. SERVER MEMBERS INTENT   - required for reliable mention resolution in guilds

DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
GUILD_IDS=123456789
ADMIN_USERS=your_discord_user_id

# Dropbox Cloud Delivery (optional)
# ----------------------------------
# When configured, audiobook chapters upload to Dropbox and shared links are posted
# in Discord. This avoids Discord's 25 MB file size limit for non-boosted servers.
# The refresh token never expires — the bot auto-refreshes access tokens as needed.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
#   2. Create a new app (Scoped access, App folder)
#   3. Under Permissions, enable: files.content.write, files.content.read, sharing.write
#      (click Submit after changing permissions!)
#   4. Copy App key and App secret from the Settings tab and paste below
#   5. Run:  python -m discord_bot.dropbox_setup
#      This opens a browser auth flow and gives you the refresh token
