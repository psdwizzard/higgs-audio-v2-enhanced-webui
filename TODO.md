# TODO

SuperCLI reads tasks from this file. Use Markdown checkbox items so they appear in the in-app Todo panel.

How to write tasks:

- Use "- [ ]" for incomplete and "- [x]" for complete.
- One task per line. You can group with headings if you like.
- Example:
  - [ ] Set up virtual environment
  - [ ] Implement feature X
  - [x] Write README

Tips:
- Use the Todo button in SuperCLI to show/hide the panel.
- Ticking a box or adding an item updates this file.
- Click Reload in the panel to pull latest changes if you edit this file externally.
